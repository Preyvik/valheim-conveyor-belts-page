# Conveyor Belts

Wooden belts that move your items and your creatures for you. Build a small factory and let automation do the hauling.

> Boars fall from their pen onto a belt. The grinder kills them. The loot rides on. The filter sends the leather to one chest, and the link puts the meat into another.

## What is new in 0.4.0

![Three lines with a level 1, 2 and 3 upgrader: the same wood and stone ride 1.5, 2.5 and 4 times as fast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preyvik/valheim-conveyor-belts-page/main/media/upgrader.gif)

- **Upgraders.** A small box in three levels. Build it next to any powered piece. The 15 nearest pieces work 1.5, 2.5 or 4 times as fast, and a power mill gives more power.
- Build Camera CHE no longer picks up items from belts.
- Every player and the server need 0.4.0.

## The pieces

Build them all with the hammer, in the **Misc** tab.

| | Piece | What it does |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ![Belt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preyvik/valheim-conveyor-belts-page/main/media/belt.gif) | **Belt** | Carries items and creatures. Comes 1 m, 2 m and 4 m long, as a left or right corner, and as a ramp up or down, with or without pillars. |
| ![Drop floor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preyvik/valheim-conveyor-belts-page/main/media/drop-floor.gif) | **Drop floor** | A floor that lets only grown creatures fall through (or only young ones). |
| ![Grinder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preyvik/valheim-conveyor-belts-page/main/media/grinder.gif) | **Grinder** | Kills every creature that rides in. The loot rides on. Do not stand in it! |
| ![Item filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preyvik/valheim-conveyor-belts-page/main/media/item-filter.gif) | **Item filter** | Sends the items and creatures on its list to the side. Everything else goes straight on. Press E to pick items, families of items and creatures. |
| ![Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preyvik/valheim-conveyor-belts-page/main/media/link.gif) | **Link** | Puts items into a smelter, kiln, windmill, spinning wheel or chest. It can also take items out of a chest. Press E to set its mode and how many items it moves. |
| ![Trash box and trash bin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preyvik/valheim-conveyor-belts-page/main/media/trash.gif) | **Trash box** | Snaps onto a link. Deletes what the chests and machines cannot take. |
| | **Trash bin** | Put it at the end of a belt. Items that fall in are gone. |
| ![Power mill and rope-drive post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preyvik/valheim-conveyor-belts-page/main/media/power.gif) | **Power mill** | A small windmill that makes power for the other pieces. |
| | **Rope-drive post** | Carries power over a gap, with a rope to another post. |
| ![Upgrader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preyvik/valheim-conveyor-belts-page/main/media/upgrader.gif) | **Upgrader** | Makes the 15 nearest pieces of its power network work faster. Level 1 (bronze) 1.5 times, level 2 (ember) 2.5 times, level 3 (blue) 4 times. |

## Power

Every belt, filter, grinder and link needs power from a **power mill**. Pieces that touch share the power. If there is not enough, they stop. Look at a piece to see why it stopped.

An **upgrader** makes the pieces near it work faster, power mills too. One piece takes the boost of one upgrader only.

## Playing with friends

Everyone must have the mod: every player and the server.

## Install

Use a mod manager (r2modman, Gale or Thunderstore Mod Manager). It installs **BepInEx** and **Jotunn** for you.

## Settings

The costs, the power numbers, the rope length and the upgraders can be changed in the config file. On a server, only an admin can change them.

Each player can also turn off `[Building] SnapToLinks`. Then chests and machines no longer snap to links.

Each player can also turn on `[Pickup] AutoPickupFromBelts`. Then auto-pickup takes items off belts again.
